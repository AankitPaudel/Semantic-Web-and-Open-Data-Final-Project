# Section 1.1 – Research Goal

This project investigates whether Premier League football clubs exhibit a measurable home advantage between the 2020–2024 seasons. Using Semantic Web technologies, we combine structured data from DBpedia and Wikidata with official match results from football-data.co.uk to build a reproducible analysis pipeline. Our goal is to quantify how often home teams win compared to away teams, and to examine whether this effect is consistent across clubs. We first use SPARQL queries to extract team metadata (stadiums, founding information, and league membership) and to attempt retrieval of match results from Linked Data endpoints. When Linked Data coverage is incomplete, we fall back to high-quality CSV data sources while preserving a linked-data-centric design. The overall objective is to demonstrate how SPARQL, Linked Data, and traditional datasets can be integrated to study home advantage in a scientifically transparent way.

# Section 1.2 – SPARQL Exploration

The SPARQL exploration phase began with the DBpedia endpoint, where we searched for suitable classes and properties to represent Premier League clubs. Rather than relying solely on a generic `dbo:SoccerClub` class, we discovered that DBpedia exposes many Premier League entities through the pattern `?team dbo:league dbr:Premier_League`, which returns season-specific resources such as “1992–93 Arsenal F.C. season.” Using this pattern, we designed a team metadata query that retrieves the team URI, English label, home stadium via `dbo:ground`, and founding date via `dbo:foundingDate`, while wrapping optional attributes in `OPTIONAL` clauses to handle missing values. We also added `FILTER (lang(?teamName) = 'en')` to avoid duplicate labels in different languages.

For match-level data, we turned to Wikidata, where football matches and seasons are modeled more explicitly. We identified key properties including `wdt:P2453` (season), `wdt:P6112` (home team), `wdt:P6113` (away team), `wdt:P585` (date), `wdt:P1350` (home goals), and `wdt:P1351` (away goals), and restricted our query to specific Premier League seasons from 2020–2024 using a `VALUES ?season { … }` clause. Initial tests showed that while Wikidata provides high-quality structure, coverage for all matches and seasons was incomplete and sometimes returned fewer than 50 usable rows after cleaning. To address this, we adopted a hybrid strategy: we attempt the SPARQL query first, and if the result size is too small, we fall back to downloading official match CSVs from football-data.co.uk and normalize them into the same schema. Finally, we experimented with an additional DBpedia query for aggregate team statistics (wins and goals) using `dbo:numberOfWins` and `dbo:numberOfGoals`, but found this data to be sparse and primarily useful for validation rather than core analysis. Together, these explorations informed the final query set and justified our decision to combine Linked Data with traditional datasets in the analysis pipeline.
